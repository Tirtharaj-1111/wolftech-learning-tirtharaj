# wolftech-learning-tirtharaj
<p>1. text-json-csv project shows reading and writing to and from text,json files<br>
<p>2. Currently studying scrapy, venv, postman, web-scraping basics, APIs. My aim is to create a composite multiconceptual project that includes Python concepts, scraping work and also writing the obtained output to a text,json and csv file. I wish to divide this project into 2 parts: html-scraping and api-scraping<br>
  2a. Installed scrapy in virtual env using Anaconda -> python -m venv scrapyvenv (Open Anaconda -> cd directory -> run command)<br>
  2b. scrapyvenv\Scripts\Activate<br>
  2c. scrapyvenv scripts issue: scrapyvenv\Scripts\Activate : File E:\Wolftech\wolftech-learning-tirtharaj\scraping-project\scrapyvenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running 
scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
  2d. set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -> Get-ExecutionPolicy -> Get-ExecutionPolicy -list <br>
  2e. scrapy startproject onescrape -> cd onescrape -> create spider -> use for loop and return<br>
  2f. use for loop and yield<br>
  2g. use for loop and print a dictionary<br> (similar to 2f but doesnt show response code)
  2h. use items container to store in a better format<br>
  2i. export to json,csv<br>
</p>
<p>3. MySQL Workbench installation and multi-conceptual exercise</p>
