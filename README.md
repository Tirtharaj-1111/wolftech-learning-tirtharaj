text-json-csv project shows reading and writing to and from text,json files
Currently studying scrapy, venv, postman, web-scraping basics, APIs. My aim is to create a composite multiconceptual project that includes Python concepts, scraping work and also writing the obtained output to a text,json and csv file. I wish to divide this project into 2 parts: html-scraping and api-scraping
